Task 2: Access control lists (ACLs)

Copy the file to the bucket and configure the access control list
Run the following command to copy the first file to the bucket:

gsutil cp setup.html gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/
To get the default access list that's been assigned to setup.html, run the following command:

gsutil acl get gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html  > acl.txt
cat acl.txt
To set the access list to private and verify the results, run the following commands:

gsutil acl set private gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html
gsutil acl get gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html  > acl2.txt
cat acl2.txt
To update the access list to make the file publicly readable, run the following commands:

gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html
gsutil acl get gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html  > acl3.txt
cat acl3.txt
